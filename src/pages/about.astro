                            Toby has spent most of his life in and around the water. As a former long-distance swimmer, he knows both the joy of swimming and the challenges that come with it — including stepping away from competition after shoulder nerve issues. That experience, combined with his curiosity, led him to study Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College London.
                            <br/><br/>
                            There, he explored biomechanics, fluid dynamics, and how the body moves through water — alongside machine learning and neuroscience. His master’s thesis focused on keeping patient data safe while improving medical AI, a project that taught him how to combine cutting-edge technology with real care for people.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Now, Toby is bringing that same mix of swimming experience, biomechanics expertise, and data safety awareness into Eddy. His goal? To make swimming feel easier, safer, and more enjoyable for everyone — especially anxious beginners who just need a little extra confidence to dive in.
